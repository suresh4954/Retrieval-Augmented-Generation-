There isn\\'t one single, universally agreed-upon \"top\" cricketer.\\n\\nHowever, here are some of the players consistently considered among the best in the world across different formats and roles:\\n\\n**For Batting:**\\n\\n*   **Virat Kohli (India):** Often cited for his incredible consistency, record-breaking achievements, and ability to perform under pressure across all formats, especially in ODIs and T20s.\\n*   **Babar Azam (Pakistan):** Currently ranked highly in all formats, known for his elegant style and prolific run-scoring, particularly in white-ball cricket.\\n*   **Steve Smith (Australia):** Considered one of the best Test batsmen of his generation, with an unorthodox but highly effective technique.\\n*   **Joe Root (England):** Another prolific Test run-scorer and former captain.\\n\\n**For Bowling:**\\n\\n*   **Jasprit Bumrah (India):** A world-class fast bowler across all formats, known for his unique action, pace, and death-bowling accuracy.\\n*   **Rashid Khan (Afghanistan):** A T20 specialist leg-spinner who dominates leagues worldwide with his wicket-taking ability and economy.\\n\\n**For All-Rounders:**\\n\\n*   **Ben Stokes (England):** A genuine match-winner with both bat and ball, especially in Test cricket, and a strong leader.\\n\\nUltimately, there\\'s no single \"top\" cricketer, as different players excel in different roles and formats.
